\section*{Shortest Path Problem}
\textbf{Path}: $Q = (i_i, \dots, i_q)$\\
\textbf{Length}: $J_Q = \sum_{h=1}^{q-1}c_{i_h,i_{h+1}}$\\
\textbf{Optimal Path}: $Q^* = \argmin_{Q\in \mathbb{Q}_{S,T}}J_Q$\\
There cannot be a negative cycle in the graph
\subsection*{Deterministic Finite State Problema (DFS)}
Equivalent to SP\\
$N = |V|$\\
$S_0 = s,\ S_N = T,\ S_k = V$\\
$x_{k+1} = u_k$\\
$g_N(T) = 0, \ g_k(x_k,u_k) = c_{x_k,u_k}$\\
Solve with DPA, $J_k(i)$ is the optimal cost of getting from $i$ to $T$ in $N-k$ moves.\\
$J_N(T) = 0$\\
$J_{N-1}(i) = c_{iT}$\\
$J_k(i) = \min_j(c_{ij} + J_{k+1}(j))$
\subsection*{Hidden Markov Models}
Can be converted in a SP problem. We use artificial nodes $s$ and $T$ and we use the negative log likelihood as the weights.
\subsection*{Label Correcting Algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}[wide, labelwidth=!, labelindent=0pt]
	\item Place node $s$ in OPEN, set $d_s=0$ and $d_j = \infty \ \forall j$
	\item Remove a node $i$ from OPEN and execute step 3 for all children of $j$ of $i$ (nodes you can go from $i$)
	\item If $d_i + c_{i,j} < d_j$ and $d_i + c_{i,j} < d_T$, set $d_j = d_i + c_{i,j}$ and set $i$ to be parent of $j$. If $j \neq T$, put $j$ in OPEN
	\item If OPEN is not empty, go to step 2
\end{enumerate}
Removing nodes from OPEN:\\
\textbf{Depth-First Search}: LIFO (Stack)\\
\textbf{Breadth-First Search}: FIFO (Queue)\\
\textbf{Best-First Search}: Node with best label (Dijkstra)
\subsection*{A*-algorithm}
Modification of LCA. In step 3, for node $j$ to be admited in OPEN, it must fulfill\\
$d_i + c_{i,j} + h_j < d_T$ where $h_j$ is a lower bound constructed from problem knowledge.
